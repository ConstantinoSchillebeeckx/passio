Through a systematic method of assessment, one can create a management strategy that will help patients understand their injury and propose an operative plan for treating their neuropathic pain. In this case, a 69-year-old patient suffered a deep laceration injury to her distal forearm, which transected several flexor/extensor tendons, "radial sensory" nerve, and 50% of her median nerve. These structures were primarily repaired within hours of her injury and overtime the patient has recovered her median nerve sensation and motor function.

Each strategy is discussed with their advantages and disadvantages in relation to other strategies.  </video:description><video:content_loc>http://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/4741948344001/4741948344001_4886001688001_4885921517001.mp4</video:content_loc><video:duration>3180</video:duration><video:publication_date>2016-05-09</video:publication_date></video:video></url><url><loc>http://passioeducation.com/sensory-nerve-transfers-for-hand-function/</loc><video:video><video:thumbnail_loc>http://passioeducation.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/160508-5-Thumbnail-Square.jpg</video:thumbnail_loc><video:title>Sensory Nerve Transfers for Hand Function</video:title><video:description>While not as popular as motor nerve transfers, sensory nerve transfers are an important component of the reconstructive algorithm for restoring sensation and/or managing pain. The type of sensory nerve transfer performed depends on whether the targeted sensory distribution is a critical or non-critical territory to reconstruct. End-to-end transfers are for critical sensation and end-to-side transfers are for non-critical sensations. This presentation demonstrates the sensory nerve transfers for restoring radial, median and ulnar nerve function and should be coupled with the associated motor reconstruction. Experimental research is also presented to warrant end-to-side nerve transfers.</video:description><video:content_loc>http://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/4741948344001/4741948344001_4885825497001_4885789077001.mp4</video:content_loc><video:duration>1781</video:duration><video:publication_date>2016-05-09</video:publication_date></video:video></url><url><loc>http://passioeducation.com/nerve-transfers-for-ulnar-nerve-injuries/</loc><video:video><video:thumbnail_loc>http://passioeducation.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/160508-4A-Thumbnail-Square.jpg</video:thumbnail_loc><video:title>Nerve Transfers for Ulnar Nerve Injuries</video:title><video:description>In this presentation, we discuss nerve transfers and reconstructive strategies for managing ulnar nerve injuries.

The two reconstructive options for managing this injury are tendon transfers and nerve transfers, each with their advantages and disadvantages. Nerve transfers are able to provide independent finger extension, however there is an associated prolonged recovery period in comparison to tendon transfers for radial nerve palsy. Electing the appropriate surgical management depends on the patient's demands and needs. Nerve transfers for radial nerve palsy includes two transfers: (1) FCR to PIN and (2) FDS to ECRB. The tendon transfer for wrist extension can be elected for an early outcome and includes the transfer of the pronator teres to ECRB tendon.

The two reconstructive options for managing this injury are tendon transfers and nerve transfers, each with their advantages and disadvantages. Nerve transfers are able to provide independent finger extension, however there is an associated prolonged recovery period in comparison to tendon transfers for radial nerve palsy. Electing the appropriate surgical management depends on the patient's demands and needs. Nerve transfers for radial nerve palsy includes two transfers: (1) FCR to PIN and (2) FDS to ECRB. The tendon transfer for wrist extension can be elected for an early outcome and includes the transfer of the pronator teres to ECRB tendon. In this case, the patient presented three months following a severe MVC and suffered a radial nerve transection associated with a humeral facture. Due to the patient's needs, the median to radial nerve transfers were elected with the pronator teres to ECRB tendon transfer.

Cross-facial nerve grafting is a reconstructive strategy used to restore smile function and eye closure in both acute and chronic unilateral injury. In an acute injury, nerve grafting provides regenerating fibers from the donor nerve on the normal side to reinnervate across the face to the similar recipient nerve on the paralyzed side. In a chronic injury where the paralyzed muscle can no longer be reinnervated, the cross-facial nerve graft serves as the first stage to a segmental free functional muscle transfer to reconstruct smile.

The supra/infraspinatus muscles are critical for shoulder function in that they initiate abduction of the arm, external rotation, and stabilization of the shoulder joint. In upper brachial plexus injuries, it is common to find a deficit in the suprascapular nerve associated with the axillary and musculocutaneous nerves due to their C5,6 root origins. These patients present with no shoulder function or elbow flexion. Reconstruction includes nerve transfers to innervate the axillary and suprascapular nerves for shoulder function. An available donor nerve for restoring the suprascapular nerve includes the spinal accessory nerve from a posterior or anterior approach. The posterior approach utilizes the distal branches of the accessory nerve that innervates the inferior segments of the trapezius. This video portrays that posterior approach. In this case, a 49-year-old male presented post-Schwannoma resection from the upper brachial plexus with a shoulder and elbow flexion deficit. To reconstruct shoulder function, a spinal accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer was elected with a medial triceps to axillary nerve transfer.

To prevent clawing and reconstruct the ulnar intrinsic hand muscles, the anterior interosseous to ulnar motor nerve transfer is an available option. This involves transferring the distal pronator quadratus branch of the anterior interosseous nerve to the fascicular motor component of the ulnar nerve. This patient had an ulnar nerve injury following two ulnar nerve transpositions and reported pain and motor deficit immediately following surgery.

Previously known as âsubmuscularâ, we have transitioned to âtransmuscularâ as this term accurately describes this transposition as through the flexor muscles. This presentation describes the controversy surrounding different types of surgeries to manage cubital tunnel and we discuss our method with details including the physical examination, surgical management, and post-operative management. This presentation was presented during a 2012 Vumedi Webinar âThe Ulnar Nerveâ and included other prominent panelists discussing their own individual experiences and techniques for management of cubital tunnel syndrome.</video:description><video:content_loc>http://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/4741948344001/4741948344001_4862244037001_4862220221001.mp4</video:content_loc><video:duration>612</video:duration><video:publication_date>2016-04-25</video:publication_date></video:video></url><url><loc>http://passioeducation.com/anterior-interosseous-ulnar-motor-supercharge-nerve-transfer/</loc><video:video><video:thumbnail_loc>http://passioeducation.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/120404-Thumbnail-Square.jpg</video:thumbnail_loc><video:title>Anterior Interosseous to Ulnar Motor Supercharge Nerve Transfer - standard</video:title><video:description>The supercharge nerve transfer is a procedure that coapts the distal end of a donor nerve to the side of the recipient nerve.
